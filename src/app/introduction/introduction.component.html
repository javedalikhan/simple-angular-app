<section class="main-section introduction">
  <p>Hi this is a sample application built in Angular 6.0.0 (latest).</p>
  <p>This small application uses few of the fundamental concepts of angular and is fully responsive.</p>
  <p>I have tried to cover the following things</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Components & Service</li>
    <li>Property Binding</li>
    <li>Dependency Injection</li>
    <li>Routing</li>
    <li>AJAX requests</li>
    <li>Responsiveness - Tested in chrome dev tool emulator</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The left or top section (in small devices) is the main-content-area. The right or bottom(in small devices) is the notification-area.</p>
    <p>The main-content-area shows a component which consumes Notifications Service which is responsible for showing the remarks in the notification-area</p>
